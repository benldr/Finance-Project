'Finance' is a simple website that involves MySQL and calling to an API. I did this task as part of a computing course called CS50. The code is a mix of my own code and some which was provided by the course by way of a starting point.

Back-end: application.py contains the majority of the back-end, whilst helpers.py contains some helper functions and dbcmds.py contains some database querying functions that I made. 
Front-end: templates/ contains the HTML pages, whilst static/ contains some CSS.
